NAME
    README - Rehash ("Revised and Enhanced Homebrewed Automatic Storytelling
    Homepage")

DESCRIPTION
    Rehash is a fork of the last open-source release of Slash, which was
    the basis of slashdot.org. Rehash is a partial rewrite of
    Slash to increase functionality, improve usability, and an incremental
    port to modern versions of Apache, perl, and mod_perl. It is designed
    for high reliability and scalability, with integrated support for MySQL
    cluster, multi-frontend support, and a strong adherence to the MVC
    development methodology, clearly abstracting user-facing code from
    backend management.

    In addition, rehash is designed to be fast, flexible, and highly
    scalable and should scale to almost any load put to it. Furthermore,
    with support for AppArmor, parameter filtering, and query hardening,
    rehash is resistant to both SQL exploitation, and server compromise
    through the frontend. As always, efforts continue to improve this
    wherever possible. As for proof of its robustness, rehash powers
    soylentnews.org, and its ancestor powered slashdot.org (which is one
    heck of a torture test).

    See INSTALL for information about installing Rehash, including hardware
    and software requirements. Read that document carefully, and follow the
    instructions as precisely as possible.

    Also see INSTALL for information on upgrading from previous versions of
    Rehash, Slash or slashcode.

    As noted in the FAQ, please send any bug reports, and subscribe to
    mailing lists, at Rehash's github page.

DOCUMENTATION
    The .pod documentation included with Rehash can be read with the
    "perldoc" program, included with perl, or translated using one of the
    many "pod2*" translators.

    Installation
        The details on how to install, and upgrade, Rehash.

        INSTALL

    API The details of the API available in Rehash.

                perldoc Slash
                perldoc Slash::Utility
                perldoc Slash::Display
                perldoc Slash::DB

        The modules represent the bulk of the public API of Rehash. The
        other Rehash modules have embedded POD to be read with perldoc, too.
        Some of the documentation here is woefully incomplete.

                use Source 'Luke';
